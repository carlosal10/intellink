        <h2>Local Experts. Global Insight.</h2>
        <p>Many Japanese companies considering overseas expansion—especially into African markets—face a critical challenge: finding trustworthy, experienced local talent. Without direct market knowledge or local networks, decision-making becomes slow, risky, and uncertain.</p>
        <p>As a workaround, some firms rely on third-country personnel, especially from Asia, due to perceived similarities with African markets. But this often leads to gaps in local relevance and on-the-ground agility.</p>
        <p>At Intellink Nippon Consulting, we offer a better approach.</p>
